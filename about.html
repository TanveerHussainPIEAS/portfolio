        <div class="paragraphFormat">
            <p class=>I'm writing to express my interest in the Web Content Manager position listed on Monster.com. I
                have experience building large, consumer-focused health-based content sites. While much of my experience
                has been in the business world, I understand the social value of this sector and I am confident that my
                business experience will be an asset to your organization.</p>
            <p>My responsibilities have included the development and management of: website editorial voice and style;
                editorial calendars; and the daily content programming and production for various websites.</p>
            <p>I have worked closely with healthcare professionals and medical editors to help them to provide the best
                possible information to a consumer audience of patients. I have also helped physicians to use their
                medical content to write user-friendly and easily comprehensible text.</p>
            <p>Experience has taught me how to build strong relationships with all departments in an organization. I
                have the ability to work within a team as well as cross-team. I can work with web engineers to resolve
                technical issues and implement technical enhancements. </p>
            <p>I am confident working with development departments to implement design and functional enhancements, and
                to monitor site statistics and conduct search engine optimization.</p>
            <p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>

            <h2>Graphic Designing</h2>
            <p>Creativity is so important to the graphic designer’s process. And it all stems from motivation. Many
                things can hinder a graphic designer’s motivation, and, in turn, creativity, such as fatigue or a heavy
                work load. Graphic designers quickly realize that they need to find innovative ways to stay creative.
            </p>
            <p>The typical cubical office setting isn’t always ideal for graphic designers. Depending on your personal
                preferences, you may need peace, quiet, comfort, etc. that an office environment just cannot provide. If
                you are able, get out of that office if its holding you back and find a location that inspires
                creativity.</p>
            <p>Creating deadlines for yourself will allow you to develop a concrete schedule and push yourself to be
                motivated. This can be especially helpful when working on multiple projects at once. It is easy to get
                overwhelmed by a heavy workload but if you stay organized and focus on one project at a time, you will
                find it easier to stay motivated.</p>
            <p>It can be extremely helpful at times to get feedback from your colleagues and peers. Sometimes it can be
                difficult to look at your work from an outside perspective after working on it for hours. Just keep in
                mind that the feedback may not always be what you want to hear. However, you are completely in control
                of which feedback you choose to listen to or not. Don’t be discouraged by negative comments.</p>
            <p>Inspiration doesn’t always come as easy as we would like it to. If it doesn’t find you immediately, don’t
                give up. Pull from varying sources of inspiration such as artwork, literature, nature, etc. You never
                know what will spark your interest and motivate you to create something amazing.</p>
